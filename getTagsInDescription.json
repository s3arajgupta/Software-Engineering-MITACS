reach out on twitter vykthurhttpstwittercomvykthur and share your work   motivation  why trackdetect hands with neural networks  there are several existing approaches to tracking hands in the computer vision domain incidentally many of these approaches are rule based eg extracting background based on texture and boundary features distinguishing between hands and background using color histograms and hog classifiers making them not very robust for example these algorithms might get confused if the background is unusual or in situations where sharp changes in lighting conditions cause sharp changes in skin color or the tracked object becomes occludedsee here for a reviewhttpswwwcseunredubebishandposerevpdf paper on hand pose estimation from the hci perspective  with sufficiently large datasets neural networks provide opportunity to train models that perform well and address challenges of existing object trackingdetection algorithms  variedpoor lighting noisy environments diverse viewpoints and even occlusion the main drawbacks to usage for realtime trackingdetection is that they can be complex are relatively slow compared to trackingonly algorithms and it can be quite expensive to assemble a good dataset but things are changing with advances in fast neural networks  furthermore this entire area of work has been made more approachable by deep learning frameworks such as the tensorflow object detection api that simplify the process of training a model for custom object detection more importantly the advent of fast neural network models like ssd faster rcnn rfcn see herehttpsgithubcomtensorflowmodelsblobmasterresearchobjectdetectiongdocdetectionmodelzoomdcocotrainedmodelscocomodels  etc make neural networks an attractive candidate for realtime detection and tracking applications hopefully this repo demonstrates this   if you are not interested in the process of training the detector you can skip straight to applying the pretrained model i provide in detecting handsdetectinghands  training a model is a multistage process assembling dataset cleaning splitting into trainingtest partitions and generating an inference graph while i lightly touch on the details of these parts there are a few other tutorials cover training a custom object detector using the tensorflow object detection api in more detail see herehttpspythonprogrammingnettrainingcustomobjectstensorflowobjectdetectionapitutorial and herehttpstowardsdatasciencecomhowtotrainyourownobjectdetectorwithtensorflowsobjectdetectorapibececfed  i recommend you walk through those if interested in training a custom object detector from scratch   data preparation and network training in tensorflow dataset import training  the egohands dataset  the hand detector model is built using data from the egohands datasethttpvisionsoicindianaeduprojectsegohands dataset this dataset works well for several reasons it contains high quality pixel level annotations  ground truth labels where hands are located across  images all images are captured from an egocentric view google glass across  different environments indoor outdoor and activities playing cards chess jenga solving puzzles etc  img srcimagesegohandstrainjpg width  if you will be using the egohands dataset you can cite them as follows   bambach sven et al lending a hand detecting hands and recognizing activities in complex egocentric interactions proceedings of the ieee international conference on computer vision   the egohands dataset zip file with labelled data contains  folders of locations where video data was collected  images per folder   locationx    framejpg    framejpg       framejpg    polygonsmat   contains annotations for all  images in current folder  locationy    framejpg    framejpg       framejpg    polygonsmat   contains annotations for all  images in current folder     converting data to tensorflow format  some initial work needs to be done to the egohands dataset to transform it into the format tfrecord which tensorflow needs to train a model this repo contains egohandsdatasetcleanpy a script that will help you generate these csv files   downloads the egohands datasets  renames all files to include their directory names to ensure each filename is unique  splits the dataset into train  test  and eval  folders  reads in polygonsmat for each folder generates bounding boxes and visualizes them to ensure correctness see image above  once the script is done running you should have an images folder containing three folders  train test and eval each of these folders should also contain a csv label document each  trainlabelscsv testlabelscsv  that can be used to generate tfrecords  note while the egohands dataset provides four separate labels for hands own left own right other left and other right for my purpose i am only interested in the general hand class and label all training data as hand you can modify the data prep script to generate tfrecords that support  labels  next convert your dataset  csv files to tfrecords a helpful guide on this can be found herehttpspythonprogrammingnetcreatingtfrecordfilestensorflowobjectdetectionapitutorialfor each folder you should be able to generate  trainrecord testrecord required in the training process    training the hand detection model  now that the dataset has been assembled and your tfrecords the next task is to train a model based on this with neural networks it is possible to use a process called transfer learninghttpswwwtensorfloworgtutorialsimageretraining to shorten the amount of time needed to train the entire model this means we can take an existing model that has been trained well on a related domain here image classification and retrain its final layers to detect hands for us sweet given that neural networks sometimes have thousands or millions of parameters that can take weeks or months to train transfer learning helps shorten training time to possibly hours tensorflow does offer a few models in the tensorflow model zoohttpsgithubcomtensorflowmodelsblobmasterresearchobjectdetectiongdocdetectionmodelzoomdcocotrainedmodelscocomodels and i chose to use the ssdmobilenetvcoco model as my start point given it is currently one of the fastest models read the ssd research paper herehttpsarxivorgpdfpdf the training process can be done locally on your cpu machine which may take a while or better on a cloud gpu machine which is what i did for reference training on my macbook pro tensorflow compiled from source to take advantage of the macs cpu architecture the maximum speed i got was  seconds per step as opposed to the  seconds per step i got with a gpu for reference it would take about  days to run k steps on my mac i ghz gb compared to hrs on a gpu   training on your own images please use the guide provided by harrison from pythonprogramminghttpspythonprogrammingnettrainingcustomobjectstensorflowobjectdetectionapitutorial on how to generate tfrecords given your label csv files and your images the guide also covers how to start the training process if training locally see here httpspythonprogrammingnettrainingcustomobjectstensorflowobjectdetectionapitutorial if training in the cloud using a service like gcp see the guide herehttpsgithubcomtensorflowmodelsblobmasterresearchobjectdetectiongdocrunningoncloudmd  as the training process progresses the expectation is that total loss errors gets reduced to its possible minimum about a value of  or thereabout by observing the tensorboard graphs for total losssee image below it should be possible to get an idea of when the training process is complete total loss does not decrease with further iterationssteps i ran my training job for k steps took about  hours and stopped at a total loss errors value of in retrospect i could have stopped the training at about k steps and gotten a similar total loss value with tensorflow you can also run an evaluation concurrently that assesses your model to see how well it performs on the test data a commonly used metric for performance is mean average precision map which is single number used to summarize the area under the precisionrecall curve  map is a measure of how well the model generates a bounding box that has at least a  overlap with the ground truth bounding box in our test dataset for the hand detector trained here the map value was iou map values range from  the higher the better     img srcimagesaccuracyjpg width  once training is completed the trained inference graph frozeninferencegraphpb is then exported see the earlier referenced guides for how to do this and saved in the handinferencegraph folder now its time to do some interesting detection   using the detector to detecttrack hands   if you have not done this yet please following the guide on installing tensorflow and the tensorflow object detection apihttpsgithubcomtensorflowmodelsblobmasterresearchobjectdetectiongdocinstallationmd this will walk you through setting up the tensorflow framework cloning the

optimization a few things that led to noticeable performance increases   threading turns out that reading images from a webcam is a heavy io event and if run on the main application thread can slow down the program i implemented some good ideas from adrian rosebuckhttpswwwpyimagesearchcomfastervideofilefpswithcvvideocaptureandopencv on parrallelizing image capture across multiple worker threads this mostly led to an fps increase of about  points  for those new to opencv images from the cvread method return images in bgr formathttpswwwlearnopencvcomwhydoesopencvusebgrcolorformat ensure you convert to rgb before detection accuracy will be much reduced if you dont python cvcvtcolorimagenp cvcolorbgrrgb   keeping your input image small will increase fps without any significant accuracy dropi used about  x  compared to the  x  which my webcam provides   model quantization moving from the current  bit to  bit can achieve up to x reduction in memory required to load and store models one way to further speed up this model is to explore the use of bit fixed point quantizationhttpsheartbeatfritzaibitquantizationandtensorflowlitespeedingupmobileinferencewithlowprecisionadfcafbbd  performance can also be increased by a clever combination of tracking algorithms with the already decent detection and this is something i am still experimenting with have ideas for optimizing better please share  img srcimagesgeneraljpg width note the detector does reflect some limitations associated with the training set this includes nonegocentric viewpoints very noisy backgrounds eg in a sea of hands and sometimes skin tone  there is opportunity to improve these with additional data    integrating multiple dnns  one way to make things more interesting is to integrate our new knowledge of where hands are with other detectors trained to recognize other objects unfortunately while our hand detector can in fact detect hands it cannot detect other objects a factor or how it is trained to create a detector that classifies multiple different objects would mean a long involved process of assembling datasets for each class and a lengthy training process     given the above a potential strategy is to explore structures that allow us efficiently interleave output form multiple pretrained models for various object classes and have them detect multiple objects on a single image    an example of this is with my primary use case where i am interested in understanding the position of objects on a table with respect to hands on same table i am currently doing some work on a threaded application that loads multiple detectors and outputs bounding boxes on a single image more on this soon",
