0. filter out projects with less than 3 stars.
    1. countT: some of the topics are the result of mistakes
and typos. Most of these appear only once or twice - sort
the topics by appearance and retrieve/store the bad ones
2.  When trying to find a topic in the description,
be careful about the multiple-word topics (preprocess them by replacing
all "-" by " "): Example: "unity-vr" => "unity vr", "unity-vr"
3. To extract new topics from the description, look at the projects
with 10 or more stars and manually extract those topics.
